## Description

Have you ever wondered what future delays would look like for an airport, so you can plan accordingly and minimize traveling pains?
FlySTAT aims to unveil the unknown and provide accurate guidance for what future delays might look like. It will answer questions like:
- Which airports will have the least probability of delays in the future?
- Given an airport or airline, when is the best time to fly during a given window?
- What kind of delays can be expected for a given airport?

Using a range of evaluation techniques varying in complexity, from simple averaging, to weighted ranking based on delay propagation and linear regression, FlySTAT will provide results that bring useful insights to both airline industries and their customer bases.
